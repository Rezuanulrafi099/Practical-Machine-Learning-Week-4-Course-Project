By comparing the accuracy rate values of the three models, it is clear the the ‘Random Forest’ model is the winner. So will use it on the validation data

Results <- predict(modRF1, newdata=validData)
Results
##  [1] B A B A A E D B A A B C B A E E A B B B
## Levels: A B C D E
The Results output will be used to answer the “Course Project Prediction Quiz”
